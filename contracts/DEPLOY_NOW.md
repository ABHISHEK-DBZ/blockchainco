## Step 1: Get Your MetaMask Private Key

### If you have MetaMask:
1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click on your account name (top center)
3. Click "Account Details"
4. Click "Export Private Key"
5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. Copy the private key (WITHOUT the 0x prefix)

### If you don't have MetaMask:
1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Create a new wallet (SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE!)
3. Follow steps above to get private key

## Step 2: Get Test MATIC Tokens (Free)

1. Add Mumbai testnet to MetaMask:
   - Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
   - Chain ID: 80001
   - Currency Symbol: MATIC

2. Get free test MATIC:
   - Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Connect your MetaMask wallet
   - Select "Mumbai" network
   - Click "Request" - you'll get 0.2 test MATIC

## Step 3: Configure Environment

Edit the .env file that was just created:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key_here_without_0x
```

## Step 4: Deploy!

Once you have:
âœ… Private key in .env file
âœ… Test MATIC in your wallet

Run this command:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

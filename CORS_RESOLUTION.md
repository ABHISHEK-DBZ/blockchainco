# 🎉 SYSTEM RESOLUTION SUMMARY

## ✅ CORS Issue Successfully Resolved!

### 🔍 Problem Identified
The frontend was encountering CORS errors when trying to access `/login` and `/register` endpoints:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/login' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check
```

### 🛠️ Solution Implemented
1. **Added Authentication Endpoints**: Created `/login` and `/register` routes in `full_backend.py`
2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensured CORS allows requests from `http://localhost:3001`
3. **Route Registration**: Verified all routes are properly registered with Flask

### 📊 Backend Status (Port 5000)

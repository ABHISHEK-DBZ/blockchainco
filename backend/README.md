# Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry Backend

This backend is built with Flask and is designed to support a blockchain-powered MRV system for blue carbon projects.

## Structure
- `app/main.py`: Flask application entry point
- `models/`: Database models (to be added)
- `routes/`: API endpoints (to be added)
- `blockchain/`: Blockchain interaction logic (to be added)
- `config.py`: Configuration settings (to be added)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

## Next Steps
- Add PostgreSQL integration
- Implement REST endpoints for restoration projects, stakeholders, and carbon credits
- Integrate blockchain interaction (Ethereum/Hyperledger)
- Prepare for IPFS integration

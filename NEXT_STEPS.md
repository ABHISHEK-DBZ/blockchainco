# ðŸš€ Blue Carbon Registry - Next Steps Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Blockchain Deployment (IMMEDIATE - Next 30 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contracts to Mumbai Testnet
```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd c:\Users\Abhishek\PycharmProjects\blockchain\contracts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file with your credentials
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here" > .env
echo "POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com" >> .env
echo "POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key" >> .env

# Deploy to Mumbai testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygonMumbai

# Verify contracts (optional)
npx hardhat verify --network polygonMumbai CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Step 2: Integrate Web3 with Frontend
